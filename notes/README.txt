This folder includes some notes currently under development on the BayesianABTesting Framework

Both versions of the tex file have the same contents, just a different document type:
- BayesianABTests.pdf
- BayesianABTests-twocolumns.pdf

This project is a Work in Progress, and these notes have even more space for improvement than the code.

For further information, please check the references on these documents.

Regards,

Hugo Pibernat
